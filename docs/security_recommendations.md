Security Features & Recommendations for Inwit Tix

This document outlines the security features currently implemented in the Inwit Tix platform and provides recommendations for future enhancements.

Current Security Features

The application has a strong security foundation with the following features already in place:

Password Hashing (bcrypt):

All user passwords are "hashed" using the industry-standard bcrypt algorithm before being stored in the database. This means that even if the database were compromised, the attackers would not be able to see the users' actual passwords.

Role-Based Access Control:

The application uses a robust role system (buyer, organizer, admin) to control access to sensitive features.

Only users with the organizer role can create events.

Only users with the admin role can access the administrative dashboard to approve new organizers.

Secure Email Activation:

New user accounts must be activated by clicking a unique, time-sensitive link sent to their email address. This verifies that the user owns the email address they signed up with.

Secure Password Reset:

The "Forgot Password" feature uses the same secure, time-sensitive token system as email activation, ensuring that only the owner of the email address can reset the password.

Rate Limiting (Brute-Force Protection):

The application uses Flask-Limiter to protect against automated attacks. It limits the number of times a single IP address can attempt to log in or register within a certain time frame, making it very difficult for bots to guess passwords.

Secure File Uploads:

The application uses werkzeug.utils.secure_filename to sanitize all uploaded filenames, preventing directory traversal attacks.

Recommended Security Enhancements

The following are the most important features to consider adding next to further protect your users and the platform.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):

What it is: An optional security layer where users must provide a second piece of information (like a code from an authenticator app) in addition to their password to log in.

Why it's important: This is the gold standard for account security and provides a very strong defense against account takeovers, even if a user's password is stolen.

Audit Logs:

What it is: A system that records important security-related events, such as when an admin approves an organizer, a user changes their password, or an organizer deletes an event.

Why it's important: It provides a clear, traceable history of actions on the platform, which is invaluable for security audits and for investigating any suspicious activity.

Enhanced Session Management:

What it is: Features like "Log out on all other devices" and automatic session timeout after a period of inactivity.

Why it's important: This gives users more control over their active login sessions and reduces the risk of an account being left open on a public or shared computer.
