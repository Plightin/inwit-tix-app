Inwit Tix: Scaling Your Application on Render

This guide outlines the strategy for scaling your Inwit Tix application to handle high volumes of traffic on the Render platform.

Can a 4GB Pro Plan handle 10,000 concurrent users?

No. A single 4GB "Pro" plan is not designed to handle 10,000 concurrent users.

Concurrent vs. Total Users: 10,000 total users visiting over a day is very different from 10,000 concurrent users, which means 10,000 people are actively making requests (loading pages, buying tickets, logging in) at the exact same time.

The Bottleneck: Your Flask application runs with a set number of "workers" (we configured 4). This means a single server can only handle a handful of simultaneous requests. At 10,000 concurrent users, your server would be completely overwhelmed, and users would see timeouts and errors.

The Database: Even if the web server could handle the traffic, your PostgreSQL database (especially a "Starter" or "Pro" plan) would be the first point of failure. 10,000 simultaneous queries for events or tickets would exhaust its resources almost instantly.

How to Architect for 10,000+ Concurrent Users

To handle 10,000 or 100,000 users, you must shift your thinking from vertical scaling (buying one, bigger server) to horizontal scaling (running many servers in parallel).

Your application is already built to support this. Here is the architecture you would need:

Horizontally Scaled Web Service:

Instead of one 4GB "Pro" instance, you would run multiple instances (e.g., 10, 20, or 50) of your web service.

Render automatically places a load balancer in front of them, distributing the 10,000 users' requests evenly across all your running servers. This prevents any single server from becoming a bottleneck.

Render's "Auto-Scaling" feature can automatically add or remove servers based on real-time traffic, so you are only paying for the power you need.

A High-Performance Database Plan:

A high-traffic web service needs a high-performance database. You would need to upgrade your PostgreSQL database to a "Pro" or "Pro Plus" plan. These plans run on more powerful, dedicated machines with more RAM and faster I/O, allowing them to handle thousands of simultaneous connections.

A Caching Layer (Redis):

To protect your database, you would add a Render Redis instance.

We would then update the app.py file to cache common database queries, such as the list of events on the homepage. This way, 99% of your traffic hits the super-fast cache instead of the slower database, dramatically improving performance and reducing load.

Recommended Render Configuration for 10,000 Concurrent Users

For a target of 10,000 concurrent users on a total user base of 100,000, your plan would look like a combination of services:

Web Service: Render Pro Plan (e.g., 4GB RAM) with 10 to 20+ Instances (or set up Auto-Scaling).

Database: Render Pro Plus PostgreSQL Plan.

Caching: Render Pro Redis Plan.

This is a professional, horizontally-scaled architecture that is fully capable of handling a major, high-traffic event.
